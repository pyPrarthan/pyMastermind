Welcome to the **Mastermind Game**! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic code-breaking game, where you try to guess the correct color sequence within a limited number of attempts.

- Feedback on correct positions and incorrect colors.
- Play as many times as you want!

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the game.
2. Enter your guess by inputting 4 colors (e.g., `R G B Y`).
3. You will receive feedback on how many colors are in the correct position and how many are correct but in the wrong position.
4. Keep guessing until you crack the code or run out of attempts!
